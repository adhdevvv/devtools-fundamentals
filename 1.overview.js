// ------------------- Overview ------------------- //
/*
  - First, if you have other awesome developer tool suggestions, put
    those in the comments below.

  - This series is meant for those who are new to development
    or are transitioning from another area of development, and are not already
    familiar with these tools at all.

  - I want to make sure you guys are in the right spot and not wasting time on
    videos that will provide you no value.

  - If you're already experienced even slightly with these tools, this series
    will do nothing for you.

  - This is NOT the deep dive on these tools. This is download/installation, recommended
    setup/configuration, and basic commands/usage.

  - Thank, subscribe, like, questions/comments, see you next time.
